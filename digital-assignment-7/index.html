<h2>Evil Death</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
The map design. As the player levels up, the enemy’s damage scales up with the player. 
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
I use random battle encounters. I also use RNG for attacks and heals. Player idle and walking animations. The player, enemy, and boss hp / damage / healing scales up with the player level.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
The hardest part was setting up the tilemaps and designing a map. I've never done that before.
Also it was difficult figuring out where certain lines of code should go, because if you put code before or after something, the whole thing messes up.
For some reason, the sound didn't work on Chrome, but it worked fine on Firefox. Now it seems to work on both browsers even though I didn't change the code.

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
    Defeat enemies to become stronger.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
NA
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
    The player can fight 5 different enemy types and 2 boss types. Each type does a different amount of damage. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
    Battle Encounters, Leveling
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
    I want them to feel a sense of progression.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
    The player can move around the map to find battles. Defeat the enemy to level up. The player can attack or heal during their turn.
    Use the arrow keys to move around the map. Use the number keys to choose your decision during battle. The player gains Ultra points every time an attack hits.
    When the player gets max Ultra points, they can use the Ultra, which does the double amount of damage from a regular attack.
    When the player levels up to level 6, they will have the chance to fight the first boss, and it will be added as a new enemy type.
    Once the player levels up to level 15, they unlock the last boss battle.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
    The player must decide when it’s a good time to attack, heal, and use their skills wisely.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
    The is world is taken over by evil. You must eradicate the evil by killing your foes.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
    People who like RPGs / Fantasy games.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Several minutes.
