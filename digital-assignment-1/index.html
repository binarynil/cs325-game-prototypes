<h2>Your game title</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
It's an endless side-scrolling shooter that randomly spawns enemies within the world.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
It randomly spawns enemies using RNG.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned how to use Phaser / Javascript. The hardest part was getting Phaser to initially work and trying to figure out why the game wouldn't start.
Coding the enemies to not fall from the world and move was also difficult.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A ninja gets attacked by evil mages in a lonely forest.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Ninjas.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
RNG to spawn enemies.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Player movement, jumping, and shooting.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want them to feel anxious from being overrun by enemies.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
    The Player can move around using the cursor / arrow keys. The player can shoot using the spacebar. Also, the player can jump using the up key.
    The player must move around to dodge enemies and shoot them. Each kill counts as 1 point. If an enemy hits the player, the player dies.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
    The player should keep moving around and jumping to avoid being overrun by the enemies. The player should also try to
    pre-emptively shoot around the enemy spawn areas.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
In a desolate and eerie forest, the Ninja roams. To his surprise, the Evil Mage has cloned himself to create an army. The Ninja
must try to stop the Evil Mage and his army, or death will arrive to the Ninja and the world.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
    The target audience is people who enjoy retro-style and arcade games.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
A few minutes to an hour.
</li>
